Problem 1. Polynomial and exponential models of error function erf()
********************************************************************

(a)
The fitted polynomials with number of degrees 1, ... ,11 are plotted
in figure 'fit_erf_results_a.png'

(b)
The fitted polynomials with odd powers of x: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  are plotted
in figure 'fit_erf_results_b.png'

(b)
The fitted exponential function with number of parameters 1, ...., 5 are plotted
in figure 'fit_erf_results_c.png'


A comparison of the three models is plotted in figure 
'max_absolute_error_fit_erf.png'. 

- Model (b) reaches the most accurate fits with smallest number of parameters

- Model (c) reaches the most accurate fits with smallest powers 
of x
