Problem 2. Kahan summation
**************************

(B)
***

Result with harmonic() of previous excercise:
vuola@nuc:~/matres/UH_NumericalMethods/build/exercise01$ ./harmonic 
times of saturation: 997902849
15.4037

Result with harmonic_kahan(N):
vuola@nuc:~/matres/UH_NumericalMethods/build/exercise02$ ./harmonic_kahan 1000000000
times of saturation: 994536834
21.3005

Comments
********

The output converges with both algorithms but is bigger with harmonic_kahan. The compensation of cumulative summation error in 
Kahan method makes the algorithm progress further in adding small terms on the cumulative sum before it saturates completely. 
( saturation here means that consecutive cumulative sums in the iteration loop are exactly equal ).
