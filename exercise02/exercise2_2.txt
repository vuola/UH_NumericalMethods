The output converges with both algorithms but is bigger with harmonic_kahan. The compensation of cumulative summation error in 
Kahan method makes the algorithm progress further in adding small terms on the cumulative sum before it saturates completely. 
( saturation here means that consecutive cumulative sums in the iteration loop are exactly equal ).
