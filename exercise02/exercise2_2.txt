Result with harmonic():
vuola@nuc:~/matres/UH_NumericalMethods/build/exercise01$ ./harmonic
15.4037

Result with harmonic_kahan(N):
vuola@nuc:~/matres/UH_NumericalMethods/build/exercise02$ ./harmonic_kahan 1000000000
21.3005

The output converges with both algorithms but is bigger with harmonic_kahan. The compensation of cumulative summation error in 
Kahan method makes the algorithm progress further in the series adding more small terms before the output value saturates.
