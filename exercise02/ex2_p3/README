Programs to solve a linear system using LAPACAK routine 'dgesv'.
The equation is read in from stdin in format:
N
A (N lines with N numbers on each)
b (the RHS of the equation)

E.g. for a system of size 3 the input might be:
3
0.60379247919382  0.27218792496996  0.19881426776106
0.74678567656443  0.44509643228795  0.93181457846166
