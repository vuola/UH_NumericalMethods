Problem 3. Analysis of function used in Newton iteration of bifurcating series
******************************************************************************

(B)
***

Looking at the figure function f(x, mu) does not have a continuous 
zero crossing any longer when mu >= 3. A singular zero at x = 2/3 is found
but the function does not give valid results with x < 2/3.
This is the same x-point where the bifurcation starts for the series.

The Newton iteration of f(x, mu) runs into difficulties as the function f(x, mu)
has an exponential term b^a where b is negative real number and a is 
non-integer real. This is not a well-defined continuous function and
even C++ complex version of pow(b,a) gives a -nan result.
