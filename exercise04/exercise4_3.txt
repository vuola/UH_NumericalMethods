Analysis of function used in newton iteration of bifurcating series
*******************************************************************

Looking at the figure, the shape of function f(x, mu) when parameter mu reaches 3 does 
not change any longer as mu is getting higher values 3.2, and 3.5.

The Newton iteration of f(x, mu) runs into difficulties as the function f(x, mu)
with mu larger than 2 has an exponential term b^a where b is negative real number
and a is non-integer real. This is not a well-defined continuous function.

For a negative base b an even integer exponent a gives a positive result and an odd
integer exponent gives a negative result. Hence, f(x, mu) is discontinous.

Intuitively, the bifurcation behaviour looks like "hopping" caused
by discontinuity points in f(x, mu).
