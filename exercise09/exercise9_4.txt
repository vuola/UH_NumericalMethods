Testing the quality of Mersenne Twister
***************************************

The moment test plot shows that both <x> and <x^2> are behaving as expected and producing
values which are centered around < <x> > = 0.5 and < <x^2> > = 0.333...
A larger N is clearly reducing the variance. 

Mersenne Twister passes the moment test well.
