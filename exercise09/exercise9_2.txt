Testing inverse cumulative distributions 
****************************************

The random numbers were generated with Mersenne twister implemented in standard C++ library. The seed was 
generated from the milliseconds of system time.

The inverse Lorenz distributed causes a problem near input probabilities 0 and 1, as the x-value approaches
-Inf and +Inf, respectively. This was solved by defining a tolerance parameter OFFSET_FROM_EXTREMES with value 
set to 0.02. In case the random input probability is closer than tolerance from either 0 or 1, a new random
number is generated and the inverse function is called recursively.

Numerically computed and closed forms of f() match quite nicely for both functions.
