# UH_NumericalMethods
### University of Helsinki course Numerical Methods In Scientific  Programming MATR322 

These are personal excercise solutions. Do not re-distribute exercises or submit solutions as your own. The development environment is open source.

## Development Environment
The algorithms are written with C++ using the Eigen mathemathical library. 

Since Python has a rich visualization library available with NumPy, the approach has been the following:

1. If the excercise does not require visualization, the C++ algorithm has been compiled into a command-line executable.
2. If a visualization is required in the excercise, the C++ algorithm has also been compiled into a library binary in a format which can be called from Python. Visualization has been implemented using Python code and a Python script has been used as the entry point for running both the algorithm and visualization.

Two interface libraries have been used to make Python and C++ interoperable. The first one is called **boost-python**. It is a well established, highly efficient C++ library which is intended for users wanting to call optimized C/C++ routines from Python scripts. 

The second interface library is called **eigenpy**. It is a fairly recent addition to the eigen C++ mathematical toolkit. Eigenpy creates a direct one-to-one linkage between eigen C++ data structures and Python/NumPy data structures, removing the need to pass data via files or to create duplicate copies of the data structures in memory.

Required dependencies and installation instructions are given below. The code has been tested in MacOs and Ubuntu.

## Running the algorithms

The easiest way to run the algorithms is via Docker. A container with executables and python scripts is available in Docker Hub. 

Install Docker and pull the container. The container opens a terminal prompt with executables and scripts in the opening directory. All executables can be called with flag --help. Only two install steps are required:

### install Docker

`sudo apt install docker.io -y`

### pull the container from Docker Hub and run

`docker run -it vuolahti/nmsc`

## Dependencies and installation instructions for Ubuntu

This chapter contains instructions for installing the full development environment. If you are familiar with Docker, you can also check docker/Dockerfile to see the same information in a Docker build script format.

### Pull the repository

`git clone https://github.com/vuola/UH_NumericalMethods.git ./UH_NumericalMethods`

### Visual Studio & CMake extensions
Visual Studio Code for Ubuntu - installation instructions can be found for example here

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-ubuntu-20-04/

CMake has been used to package the code into transportable format  and to compile / link efficiently. First install cmake:

`sudo apt install cmake`

With Visual Studio Code CMake tools are available as an extension module. From Visual Studio top menu, select *View - Extensions* and install extension named **CMake Tools**. For debugging you will also need extension **C/C++ Extension Pack** from Microsoft. 

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, cd into the repository *UH_NumericalMethods* and run

`code .`

### C++
During testing MacOS was running Clang 13.1.6 and Ubuntu used gcc 9.3.0 as the C++ compiler.

### Python 3
The Python version used during testing was 3.11. Eigenpy library requires at least Python version 3.5. The Docker container runs Python 3.8. If you have a Python version 3.8 or newer, it is safe to use the current version. 

### Pip3

If you have *python3* but not the package manager *pip3*, run

`sudo apt install python3-pip`

#### Python3 libraries

`pip3 install numpy`

`pip3 install matplotlib`

`pip3 install scipy`

`pip3 install mpmath`

`pip3 install sympy`

### C++ libraries

#### Eigen

Install and extract the eigen archive file into the root of this repository. 

`curl -o eigen-3.4.0.tar.bz2 https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.tar.bz2`

`tar -xvjf eigen-3.4.0.tar.bz2`

Eigen installation instructions are located in file `<repository root>/eigen-3.4.0/INSTALL`, you can run the steps of CMake users as follows:

`mkdir eigen3`

`cd eigen3`

`cmake ../eigen-3.4.0`

#### boost

The following command will install all boost libraries (a lot more than just boost-python). In Ubuntu 22.04 distribution with Python 3.10 included the boost-python binary is already included so boost installation is not required.

`sudo apt install libboost-all-dev`

#### eigenpy

`sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -cs) robotpkg' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list"`

`curl http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/robotpkg.key | sudo apt-key add -`

At this point you need to update package lists

`sudo apt update`

The following command is for Python 3.8, replace the version code with your Python version (without dot)

`sudo apt install robotpkg-py38-eigenpy`

Check out what the install location is for package 'eigenpy' with command

`sudo find / -name "eigenpy" | grep cmake`

If the location path starts with */opt/openrobots* everything should be fine. Otherwise consider editing the main *CMakeLists.txt* file in the repository root. The directives for setting *eigenpy* search path are the following:

`cmake_policy(SET CMP0074 NEW)`

`set(eigenpy_ROOT /opt/openrobots)`

`find_package(eigenpy)`

CMake is expecting to find file *eigenpyConfig.cmake* from one of the subdirectories.

#### other math libraries used

Some of the exercises use these math libraries

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install libgsl-dev`

`sudo apt install liblapack-dev libblas-dev`

If everything is working, running *Build* from the low frame icon of Visual Studio Code will place the target files into folders /build/excercise[nn].
